<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mucopolysaccharidosis Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intracerebroventricular (ICV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) treatment market comprises various administration routes, primarily intravenous (IV) and intracerebroventricular (ICV). Intravenous treatments involve delivering medications directly into the bloodstream, allowing for rapid systemic distribution, which is crucial for managing systemic symptoms. In contrast, intracerebroventricular treatment involves administering therapies directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, targeting neurological manifestations effectively. Both methods aim to alleviate the burdensome effects of MPS, optimizing symptom management and improving patient quality of life through tailored therapeutic approaches.</p></p>
