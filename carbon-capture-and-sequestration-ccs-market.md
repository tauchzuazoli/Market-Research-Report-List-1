<p><h1>Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) Market Size, Market Share and Global Market Analysis Report, 2025 - 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is a technology aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) produced from industrial processes or energy production before it enters the atmosphere. The captured CO2 is then transported and stored underground in geological formations, ensuring it remains isolated from the atmosphere. This approach is crucial in mitigating climate change and transitioning to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>The CCS market is experiencing significant growth, driven by an increasing focus on sustainability, regulatory pressures to reduce carbon emissions, and advancements in technology. This market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.4% during the forecast period. Several industries, including power generation, cement, and oil and gas, are actively investing in CCS technologies to comply with emission reduction targets and enhance their sustainability profiles.</p><p>Recent trends indicate a surge in government policies and funding initiatives supporting CCS projects, alongside a rise in collaborative efforts between public and private sectors. Innovations in CCS technologies, such as direct air capture and improved storage techniques, are also emerging, making the market more dynamic. Overall, CCS represents a critical strategy for achieving global climate goals and enhancing energy security.</p></p>
