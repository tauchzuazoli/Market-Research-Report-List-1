<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Thermometer Gun Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld thermometer gun market is primarily categorized into two types: non-contact and contact types. Non-contact thermometers utilize infrared sensors to measure body temperature from a distance, reducing the risk of cross-contamination and providing quick readings. These are popular for screening in public spaces. Contact thermometers, on the other hand, require direct contact with the skin to measure temperature accurately. They tend to be more precise but can pose hygiene concerns and may take slightly longer for readings.</p></p>
